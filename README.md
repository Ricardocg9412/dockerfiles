## dockerfiles

[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/jfrazelle/dockerfiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jfrazelle/dockerfiles)

This is a repo to hold various Dockerfiles. I forked it from
[jess's dockerfiles repo](github.com/jfrazelle/dockerfiles).

I try to make sure each has a command at the top for running it,
or a small script in the same directory as the Dockerfile.

Some of these live on the Docker Hub under
[soulshake](https://hub.docker.com/u/soulshake/).

If you run a lot of desktop applications in containers, you may also be
interested in [clink](https://github.com/soulshake/clink).
